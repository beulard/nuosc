# nuosc
Source code for my master's research project on neutrino oscillations. 

This repo contains simulation and analysis code written in C++ (run the ROOT interpreter), as well as the 
LaTeX source for my dissertation and the associated presentation.

This work is concerned with the simulation of neutrino oscillations in flight, and the potential sensitivity
of future experiments such as DUNE to the oscillation parameters, especially the charge-parity violating
phase $\delta_{CP}$.
